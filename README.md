# Solo Bingo

##### By Rebecca Piper



An app that allows people to play a solo game of Bingo (just for fun, no winnings!).

###Basic Design

### To Do

-Types of Game:

```
As a bingo player
So I can vary the type of game
I want to be able to pick the way to win (eg. Four Corners, Full House etc.)
```
### Future Plans

-I want a function that checks if the game has been won or not. (If it has, then clicking the word 'Bingo!' would bring up a message saying the game had been won.)
-I'd like the option to choose different ways of winning the game - four corners, a line, a full house - which would change the conditions for the game to be considered won.
-I'd want the calling of the numbers to be done automatically every 20/30 seconds instead of by manually pressing a button.
-Given more time, I'd want to look over how I've generated the Bingo Cards to see if there is a simpler, more reliable way. If not, I want to finish my code so that it always produces rows with five numbers and four spaces.
-Complete the CSS styling.
